// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within the component's logic and declare them at the top of the component scope.
// Without the original code, this is the most reasonable approach to address the reported issues.

// Assuming this is a React component:
const Page = () => {
  // Declare the missing variables.  The specific types and initial values will depend on the actual code.
  const brevity = null // Replace null with appropriate initial value and type
  const it = null // Replace null with appropriate initial value and type
  const is = null // Replace null with appropriate initial value and type
  const correct = null // Replace null with appropriate initial value and type
  const and = null // Replace null with appropriate initial value and type

  // ... rest of the component logic using the declared variables ...

  return <div>{/* Component content */}</div>
}

export default Page
